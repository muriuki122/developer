Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
Running the Program
After compiling, run the program with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./calculator
Usage
The program will prompt you to enter an operation and the necessary numbers:

Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, ^).
Enter the first number.
Enter the second number (if the operation requires it).
The program will then output the result of the calculation.

Example
mathematica
Copy code
Simple Calculator
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, ^ for power): +
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Result: 8
Note
Division by zero is not allowed and will result in an error message.
The program will print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
Functions
The following functions are defined in the program:

double add(double a, double b): Returns the sum of a and b.
double subtract(double a, double b): Returns the difference between a and b.
double multiply(double a, double b): Returns the product of a and b.
double divide(double a, double b): Returns the quotient of a and b. Throws an error if b is zero.
double power(double base, double exponent): Returns the result of raising base to the power of exponent.
double squareroot(double number): Returns the square root of number.
double calculatelogarithms(double number): Returns the natural logarithm of number.
